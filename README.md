# Autoregister new employee on travel management software Paytrack
## A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in Python that creates a user at the travel management software Paytrack when a new employee is completely onboarded.

This project is just a demonstration of a similir project of mine, developed at the "Manchester Investimentos" financial department.
